# React Documentation Project

This project is an implementation of the React documentation, providing an interactive and hands-on learning experience for developers interested in mastering React. The project includes various improvements suggested in the documentation to enhance your understanding and proficiency in React development.

## Features:

- **Tic Tac Toe Game:** Explore the fundamental concepts of React by building a Tic Tac Toe game.
- **Interactive History:** View the history of moves and jump to any point in the game.

## Implemented Improvements:

1. **Show Current Move**:<br>
For the current move, it displays "You are at move #..." instead of a button.

2. **Dynamic Square Creation**:<br>
The Board component now uses two loops to dynamically create squares, avoiding hardcoding.

3. **Sort Moves Toggle**:<br>
Added a toggle button to sort moves in either ascending or descending order.

Winning squares are now highlighted with a yellow background when someone wins.

5. **Display Draw Result**:<br>
When the result is a draw, a corresponding message is displayed.
